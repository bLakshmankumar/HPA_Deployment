In Kubernetes, a ConfigMap is an API object that provides a way to store configuration data separately from the container image. 

It allows you to decouple configuration data from the container image, which makes it easier to manage and update the configuration data without having to rebuild the container image.

ConfigMaps can be used to store any type of configuration data, such as environment variables, command-line arguments, configuration files, or any other key-value pairs that your application needs.

The configuration data can be used by your application running in a container, or by other Kubernetes objects such as deployments, services, or pods.

# Here are some examples of how ConfigMaps can be used in Kubernetes -:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Storing configuration data for an application -:

    If your application requires certain configuration data such as database connection strings, API keys, or other settings, you can store this data 
    in a ConfigMap and mount it as a volume in your container. Your application can then read the configuration data from the mounted volume at runtime.

# Setting environment variables for a container -: 
  
    You can create a ConfigMap with key-value pairs representing environment variables, and then set these environment variables in your container by referencing the ConfigMap.

# Providing configuration data to multiple containers -:

    If you have a multi-container pod, you can use a single ConfigMap to provide configuration data to all the containers in the pod.

Overall, ConfigMaps are a useful way to manage configuration data in Kubernetes, making it easier to manage, update, and share configuration data across different objects

# Practical view point -:
# -----------------------
  > The purpose of ConfigMaps is to provide a way to manage configuration data independently of containerized applications.
  > By separating configuration from application code, ConfigMaps make it easier to manage configuration changes and updates.
  
 # Here's an example of a YAML file that creates a ConfigMap named my-configmap with two key-value pairs:
 
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-configmap
data:
  app.properties: |
    property1=value1
    property2=value2
  db.properties: |
    db.host=example.com
    db.port=3306
    
# Once the ConfigMap is created, you can use it in a Pod definition to inject the configuration data into your container. 

# Here's an example of a Pod definition that uses the my-configmap ConfigMap:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    envFrom:
    - configMapRef:
        name: my-configmap
  replicas: 10
  
# In this example, the Pod definition specifies that the my-container container should use environment variables derived from the my-configmap ConfigMap.
# The envFrom field specifies that the container should use all the key-value pairs in the ConfigMap as environment variables.

# Note that the replicas field in the Pod definition specifies the number of replicas of the Pod that should be created.
# In this case, the value is set to 10, which means that Kubernetes will create 10 copies of the Pod, each with its own set of environment variables derived from the my-configmap ConfigMap.
