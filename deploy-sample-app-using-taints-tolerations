Steps To deploy An application with Taints and Tolerations on specific node group -: 
===============================================================
Step -1 -: 
-----------
First, we need to taint the node group that we want to use with a specific key-value pair. For example, let's say we want to taint a node group with the key-value pair app=acme.

 we  can use the following command to taint the nodes in the node group:

         > kubectl taint nodes <node-group-name/Node-ip> app=acme:NoSchedule

This command will taint the nodes in the specified node group with the special=true key-value pair and set the effect to NoSchedule.

This means that no pods will be scheduled on these nodes unless the pod has a matching toleration.

Step - 2 -: 
--------------
Now, we can create a deployment for our application and specify a toleration that matches the taint on the node group. Here's an deployment YAML file:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: acme-fitness
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
	matchLabels:
  	app: my-app
  template:
	metadata:
  	labels:
    	app: my-app
	spec:
  	tolerations:
  	- key: app
    	operator: Equal
    	value: "acme"
    	effect: NoSchedule
  	containers:
  	- name: my-app-container
    	image: imagename:latest
    	ports:
    	- containerPort: 80

we're creating a deployment for an application called  acme-fitness. We've added a tolerations section to the deployment specification, which specifies that the deployment can tolerate nodes with a taint that has the special=true key-value pair and the NoSchedule effect.

This allows the deployment to be scheduled on the nodes in the specified node group.

Note -: 
----------
Note that we can use the kubectl describe nodes <node-name> command to view the taints and tolerations for a specific node.
